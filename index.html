	<h4>What is this?</h4>
	<p>
		<code>news.brain.run</code> is an experiment in which I have run a data-orchestration pipeline against the <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/rss.html">arVix.org feed</a> of the latest articles published in the new (November 2023) <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html">Accessible HTML format</a> and have feed this pipeline into a number of bespoke LLM summarization chains. I then feed these into a <a href="https://duckdb.org/">duckdb database</a> which is pulled into this display by <a href="https://streamlit.io/">streamlit.io</a>.
	</p>
	<h4>I still don't get it, would you kindly explain this to me?</h4>
	<p>
		Basically I gathered a bunch o' academic articles, threw a robot at it to summarize it for me, then published those summaries here. The robots take a bit to figure out these articles because I ask them a lot of questions, so I set it up so the robots can do this stuff in the background. All of this is pretty inexpensive and I hope to make a cheap little robot for anyone to learn how stuff works.
